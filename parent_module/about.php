  <p style="margin-top:40px; font-weight: normal;">
The purpose of the developed system entitled “E-skwela: An Online Distance Elearning Tool
for Sto. Cristo Integraded School” aims to help students, teachers and even parents to have
a systematized, organized, and accessible learning. For Teachers, this would allow them to
make quizzes, activities, and assignments accessible to the students online by using their
individual accounts and makes grading more systematized. Grades are posted privately where
students can have an easy access for them to see their actual growth. This will lessen the
burden to parents who needed to collect and submit the work or task of their children. With
all being said this system will avoid confusions and promotes fast pace in our current times.
In addition, this E-learning tool also serves as an Official Website of the school which
provides a range of information with regards to upcoming school activities and programs and
a brief detail of the school’s history, facilities, it’s mission and vision. The researchers
developed a system that will solve some of the major problems of the school regarding the
modular learning setup. The developed system is going to be useful and helpful to the Teachers,
Students and even to the parents. The user will need internet access for them to be able to
access the Web-Based, so it would be easy for them to access the developed system.
